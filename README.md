Abstract: Edge intelligence is anticipated to underlay the pathway to connected intelligence for 6G networks, but the organic confluence of edge computing and artificial intelligence still needs to be carefully treated. This article discusses the concepts of edge intelligence from the semantic cognitive perspective. Two instructive theoretical models for edge semantic cognitive intelligence (ESCI) are first established. Afterwards, the ESCI framework orchestrating deep learning with semantic theory is presented. The document also provides typical applications of ESCI in 6G networks.

Abstract : The recent upsurge of smart cities’ applications and their building blocks in terms of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), federated and distributed learning, big data analytics, blockchain, and edge-cloud computing has urged the design of the upcoming 6G network generation, due to their stringent requirements in terms of the quality of services (QoS), availability, and dependability to satisfy a Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) for the end users. Industries and academia have started to design 6G networks and propose the use of AI in its protocols and operations.

Abstract:
The paper presents a novel vision on the application of blockchain technology to empower the dynamic service provisioning in future 6G mobile networks. It proposes a platform for decentralized service level agreement (SLA) negotiation between users and mobile network operators (MNOs) based on smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. The paper also introduces a new quality of experience (QoE) model for end-users to customize their trade-off between SLA and service price. Additionally, it outlines a method for dynamic service selection among multiple MNOs to provide border-less connectivity for end-users with guaranteed QoE, regardless of the serving MNO. The proposed approach aims to address the limitations of the traditional centralized service provision model and enable a more flexible and user-centric approach to service selection and provisioning in 6G mobile networks.
